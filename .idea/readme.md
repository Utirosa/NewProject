This application is intended to model a mobile phone operator site.

The clients of the operator need to have their profile pages 
giving access to look at and to modify their tariffs and options 
and to block/unblock their phone numbers.

The operator sales managers need to have a range of possibilities:
1. overview all clients and contracts;
2. search clients by their phone numbers;
3. add new contracts with new clients using unique phone numbers;
4. tariff change, adding and removing options for a client;
5. tariff change, adding and removing options for the whole tariff;
6. creating new and deleting old tariffs;
7. options control (some can only be purchased together or can exclude each other)
8. block/unblock clients.

Any modifying actions should be represented in a shopping cart till the changes are saved.

This needs to be a client-server application with data storage in a database.
The client needs to have a GUI.
The application needs to be able to handle exceptions.
